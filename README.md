# Dash-Flask-Users

A template Dash App with basic user permissions (admin & non-admin) and user management (create new user & update password).


# Database Setup

Default database setup is MySQL and the required table can be setup using the table_create_statement in /db.

The database username, password, and table name need be entered in to config.txt.

Other databases can be used - refer to SQLAlchemy for required connection statement and update in config.txt.
